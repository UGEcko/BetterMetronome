# Better Metronome (ChroMapper Plugin)

A simple plugin that fixes the annoying double ticking with the metronome. This was fixed in [commit bc9aacb
](https://github.com/Caeden117/ChroMapper/commit/bc9aacb0cf9059ac61356d281fa37c882a0647a5) and should be fixed by the next dev update, however this has been fixed since december and the next CM update has been taking FOREVER.

So... Please delete this plugin if you are planning on updating to dev when that day comes.

(Secret: I may also add some extra functionality so you can also add your own metronome sounds shhhhhhh)
